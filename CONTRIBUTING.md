# Contributing
I really appreciate every contribution and suggestion. Feel free to ask questions as well!

## Issues and suggestions
If you experience an issue (crash, lag, etc.) or want to suggest a feature, create an issue
to let others know. If you want to fix the issue by yourself, open a pull request instead.

## Contributing code
Try to match the coding style that's already present (may not be 100% consistent, sorry about that!).
